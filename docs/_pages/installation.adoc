== System requirements

Fractor requires Ruby 3.0 or later. It relies on Ractor, which is available in
Ruby 3.0+.

Fractor supports:

* **Ruby 3.0 - 3.x**: Full support using `Ractor.yield` for message passing
* **Ruby 4.0+**: Full support using `Ractor::Port` for improved communication patterns

The user-facing API is identical across both versions. Fractor automatically
detects your Ruby version and uses the appropriate internal implementation. See
link:architecture.adoc#ruby-version-compatibility[Architecture: Ruby Version Compatibility]
for details on the internal differences.

To check your Ruby version:

[source,sh]
----
ruby --version
----

If you need to install or upgrade Ruby, see https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/.

== Installation methods

=== Using RubyGems

Install Fractor directly from RubyGems:

[source,sh]
----
gem install fractor
----

=== Using Bundler

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'fractor'
----

Then execute:

[source,sh]
----
bundle install
----

=== From source

To install Fractor from source:

[source,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/fractor.git
cd fractor

[source,ruby]
----
require 'fractor'
puts Fractor::VERSION
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Ruby version issues

If you encounter errors about Ractor not being available, ensure you're using
Ruby 3.0 or later:

[source,sh]
----
ruby --version
# Should show 3.0.0 or higher
----

=== Installation errors

If you encounter permission errors during installation:

[source,sh]
----
# Use --user-install flag
gem install fractor --user-install

# Or use a Ruby version manager like rbenv or rvm
----

=== Platform-specific issues

==== macOS

On macOS, you may need to install Ruby via Homebrew if the system Ruby is too old:

[source,sh]
----
brew install ruby
----

==== Windows

On Windows, use RubyInstaller (https://rubyinstaller.org/) to install Ruby 3.0+.

==== Linux

Most Linux distributions provide Ruby in their package managers:

[source,sh]
----
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ruby-full

# Fedora/CentOS
sudo dnf install ruby

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ruby
----
