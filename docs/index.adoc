== Fractor Documentation

Fractor is a powerful parallel processing framework for Ruby that leverages Ractors to provide true concurrent execution without the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations.

== What's New

=== Recent Updates

* ✨ **Enhanced Workflow System**: Added support for circuit breakers, retry strategies, and dead letter queues
* 📊 **Performance Monitoring**: New performance monitoring capabilities with Prometheus and JSON export support
* 🔄 **Improved Error Handling**: Rich error categorization with automatic retry logic for transient failures
* 📚 **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete tutorials, guides, and reference documentation with 18+ real-world examples
* 🛠️ **Production Ready**: Battle-tested patterns for continuous mode, signal handling, and graceful shutdown
* 🎯 **Workflow Visualizer**: Built-in tools for visualizing complex workflow graphs and execution traces

See the link:../ROADMAP.md[Roadmap] for full details on completed features and upcoming enhancements.

== Quick Start

Get started with Fractor in minutes:

[source,ruby]
----
require 'fractor'

class MyWork < Fractor::Work
  def initialize(value)
    super({ value: value })
  end
end

class MyWorker < Fractor::Worker
  def process(work)
    result = work.input[:value] * 2
    Fractor::WorkResult.new(result: result, work: work)
  end
end

supervisor = Fractor::Supervisor.new(
  worker_pools: [{ worker_class: MyWorker }]
)

supervisor.add_work_items([MyWork.new(1), MyWork.new(2), MyWork.new(3)])
supervisor.run

puts supervisor.results.results.map(&:result)
# => [2, 4, 6]
