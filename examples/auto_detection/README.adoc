= Auto-Detection Example

This example demonstrates Fractor's automatic worker detection feature.

== Purpose

Shows how Fractor can automatically detect the number of available processors on your system and create the optimal number of workers without manual configuration.

== What This Demonstrates

* How Fractor automatically detects the number of available processors
* Comparison between auto-detection and explicit worker configuration
* Mixed configuration (some pools with auto-detection, some explicit)
* How to verify the number of workers being used

== When to Use Auto-Detection

* For portable code that adapts to different environments
* When you want optimal resource utilization without manual tuning
* For development where the number of cores varies across machines

== When to Set Explicit Values

* When you need precise control over resource usage
* For production environments with specific requirements
* When limiting workers due to memory or other constraints

== Running the Example

[source,shell]
----
ruby examples/auto_detection/auto_detection.rb
----

== Expected Output

The script will:

1. Display the number of processors detected on your system
2. Run three examples:
   * Example 1: Auto-detection (uses all available processors)
   * Example 2: Explicit configuration (uses exactly 4 workers)
   * Example 3: Mixed configuration (combines both approaches)
3. Show results from processing work items in parallel
4. Provide a summary of benefits for each approach

== Key Takeaways

* Auto-detection provides automatic adaptation to different environments
* Explicit configuration provides precise control when needed
* You can mix both approaches in the same supervisor
* Best practice: use auto-detection for development, tune for production if needed
