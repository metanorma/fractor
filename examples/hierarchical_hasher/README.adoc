== Overview

The Hierarchical Hasher example demonstrates how to use the Fractor framework to process a file in parallel by breaking it into chunks, hashing each chunk independently, and then combining the results into a final hash.

This example is particularly useful for:

* Processing large files efficiently
* Demonstrating parallel data chunking patterns
* Showcasing result aggregation techniques

== Implementation Details

The example consists of the following key components:

=== ChunkWork

A subclass of `Fractor::Work` that represents a chunk of a file to be hashed. Each `ChunkWork` instance contains:

* The chunk data
* The starting position within the file
* The length of the chunk

=== HashWorker

A subclass of `Fractor::Worker` that processes `ChunkWork` instances by:

1. Calculating a SHA-256 hash for the chunk
2. Returning a work result containing the hash, start position, and length

=== FileHasher

The main orchestration class that:

1. Breaks a file into chunks of a specified size
2. Creates a `Fractor::Supervisor` with the `HashWorker` and `ChunkWork` classes
3. Processes all chunks in parallel
4. Aggregates the results to create a final hash by combining all chunk hashes

== Usage

[source,ruby]
----
# Basic usage
ruby hierarchical_hasher.rb <file_path> [worker_count]

# Examples
ruby hierarchical_hasher.rb sample.txt         # Use default 4 workers
ruby hierarchical_hasher.rb large_file.dat 8   # Use 8 workers
----

== How It Works

1. The file is divided into 1KB chunks (configurable)
2. Each chunk is assigned to a worker for processing
3. Workers calculate SHA-256 hashes for their assigned chunks
4. Results are collected and sorted by their original position in the file
5. The individual chunk hashes are concatenated with newlines
6. A final SHA-256 hash is calculated on the combined hash string

== Performance Considerations

* The chunk size can be adjusted to optimize performance for different file types
* The number of workers can be increased for better parallelization on multi-core systems
* Very small files may not benefit from parallelization due to the overhead

== Ractor Compatibility Note

This example uses SHA-256 instead of SHA3 because the SHA3 implementation in some Ruby versions is not Ractor-compatible.
