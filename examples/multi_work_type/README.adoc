= Multi-Work Type Example

== Overview

This example demonstrates how to handle multiple types of work items within a single Fractor supervisor. It shows how a single worker can process different work types intelligently, applying different strategies based on the work's type.

== Key Concepts

* *Multiple Work Types*: Supporting different work classes within the same system
* *Polymorphic Processing*: Workers that adapt their processing based on work type
* *Type Detection*: Identifying and handling different work types appropriately
* *Unified Workflow*: Managing diverse work through a common supervisor

== Example Explanation

This example implements a system that processes two distinct work types:

1. *TextWork*: Handles text in various formats (plain text, Markdown, HTML, JSON)
2. *ImageWork*: Processes image data with different dimensions and formats

A single worker type (`MultiFormatWorker`) is capable of handling both work types, adapting its processing strategies based on the work's class.

== Features Demonstrated

* Creating and using multiple work type classes
* Designing workers that can handle diverse work types
* Type-based processing logic
* Proper error handling across different work types
* Classification and reporting of heterogeneous results

== Running the Example

[source,sh]
----
ruby examples/multi_work_type/multi_work_type.rb
----

== Expected Output

The example will show:
* Processing of multiple work types
* Different processing strategies applied to each type
* Type-specific result formats
* Performance statistics for each work type
* Aggregated results organized by type
