= Pipeline Processing Example

== Overview

This example demonstrates the Pipeline Processing pattern implemented with Fractor. In this pattern, data flows through a series of sequential processing stages, where the output of one stage becomes the input to the next.

== Key Concepts

* *Pipeline*: A series of connected processing stages
* *Data Flow*: Information passes through each stage in sequence
* *Transformation*: Each stage performs a specific operation on the data
* *Concurrency*: Multiple items can be at different stages of the pipeline simultaneously

== Example Explanation

This example processes data through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. *Input Stage*: Raw data is prepared for processing
2. *Processing Stages*: Data moves through a series of transformations
3. *Output Stage*: Final results are collected and reported

Each stage of the pipeline can run concurrently on different workers, allowing for efficient parallel processing while maintaining the required order of operations.

== Features Demonstrated

* Sequential processing with dependencies between stages
* Concurrent execution of pipeline stages
* Processing optimizations through specialized workers
* Handling data flow between processing stages

== Running the Example

[source,sh]
----
ruby examples/pipeline_processing/pipeline_processing.rb
----

== Expected Output

The example will show:
* Data moving through each stage of the pipeline
* Workers processing different stages concurrently
* The transformation of data at each stage
* Final results after passing through the complete pipeline
