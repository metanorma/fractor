== Overview

The Producer-Subscriber example demonstrates how to use the Fractor framework to implement a multi-stage document processing system. This example showcases how initial work can generate additional sub-work items, creating a hierarchical processing pattern.

This example is particularly useful for:

* Implementing producer-consumer patterns in parallel systems
* Managing dependencies between work items
* Building hierarchical result structures from parallel processing

== Implementation Details

The example consists of the following key components:

=== InitialWork

A subclass of `Fractor::Work` that represents a document to be processed. Each `InitialWork` instance contains:

* The document data
* A depth level (always 0 for initial work)

=== SubWork

A subclass of `Fractor::Work` that represents a section of a document. Each `SubWork` instance contains:

* The section data
* A reference to its parent work via `parent_id`
* A depth level (typically depth + 1 from its parent)

=== MultiWorker

A versatile worker that can process both `InitialWork` and `SubWork` instances:

* For `InitialWork`: Processes the document and identifies sections
* For `SubWork`: Processes individual sections

=== DocumentProcessor

The main orchestration class that:

1. Creates a supervisor for initial document processing
2. Analyzes results to identify additional work (sections)
3. Creates a second supervisor for processing sections
4. Builds a hierarchical result tree from both stages

== Usage

[source,ruby]
----
# Example document list
documents = [
  "Annual Report 2025",
  "Technical Documentation",
  "Research Paper"
]

# Process documents with 4 workers
processor = ProducerSubscriber::DocumentProcessor.new(documents, 4)
result = processor.process

# Print the hierarchical results
puts result
----

== How It Works

1. Initial documents are added to the processing queue
2. Each document is processed in parallel by workers
3. For each document, multiple sub-sections are identified (3 per document)
4. These sub-sections are then processed in a second phase
5. Results from both phases are combined into a hierarchical tree structure
6. The final output presents documents with their processed sections

== Multi-stage Processing Pattern

This example demonstrates a powerful pattern for parallel processing:

1. *First Stage Processing*: Process high-level items and identify additional work
2. *Work Generation*: Create new work items based on first-stage results
3. *Second Stage Processing*: Process the generated work items
4. *Result Aggregation*: Combine results from both stages into a cohesive structure

== Object Identity and References

Note that this example uses `object_id` to maintain references between parent and child work items. This approach allows building a hierarchical result structure when processing is complete.
