= Scatter Gather Example

== Overview

This example demonstrates the Scatter-Gather pattern with Fractor. In this pattern, work is scattered (distributed) across multiple workers for parallel processing, and then the results are gathered and combined.

== Key Concepts

* *Scatter*: A primary task is broken down into multiple subtasks
* *Parallel Processing*: Each subtask is processed concurrently by different workers
* *Gather*: Results from all subtasks are collected and aggregated
* *Final Processing*: The aggregated results are combined to form the final output

== Example Explanation

This example processes a large dataset by:

1. Breaking it down into smaller chunks (scatter)
2. Processing each chunk in parallel using Fractor workers
3. Collecting the processed chunks (gather)
4. Combining the results for the final output

== Features Demonstrated

* Effective workload distribution
* Parallel processing for improved performance
* Result aggregation from multiple workers
* Error handling in a distributed computation context

== Running the Example

[source,sh]
----
ruby examples/scatter_gather/scatter_gather.rb
----

== Expected Output

The example will show:
* The input data being broken into chunks
* Workers processing the chunks in parallel
* Results being gathered from workers
* The final aggregated results
